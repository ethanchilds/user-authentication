# Overview

This software is a simple C++ user authentication program. What this program does is first asks a user if they have an account. After finding out if they have an account, if they have one, the program will ask for their credentials and then log them in. If the user does not have an account they will be prompted for the information to create said account, and after entering said information the account will be created and registered.

My main purpose in writing this software was to learn how the major conventions of C++ and how to work with files in C++. This project has helped me learn and get comfortable in a new language and IDE. This project is by no means incredibly advanced, however, it did give me the opportunity to learn foundational C++.
